Pallav(11/1):
    We can use tensorflow & keras for machine-learning using Neural Networks.

    1. The Observation space is discrete 500, so this can be the input layer, 
    2. Add hidden layers
    3. Out action space is discrete 6,, this can be the output layer. 

    We decide which action to take based on the outcome with the best probability.
    We can train this neural network to play the game.
    How? - IDK? - Use reward system somehow.
