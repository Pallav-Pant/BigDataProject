    There are 3 main python files within the Taxi folder. 
    Taxi_Main.py contributes to training the agent to understand the enviroment and collect the data so that it can be finalized and tested with final runs. 
    Taxi_Tester.py tests the agent after it has finished training to see the preformance of the AI.
    Taxi_Functions.py is where all of the functions used in training and testing are stored, along with the agent.

    The other 2 files are Taxi_Runs_Data.png and Taxi_Run_Data.json are data files that hold information about the runs.

    The runs folder holds all of the json files information about the total training sequence.
